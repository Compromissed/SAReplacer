## Usage

Created it because changing every SladeAbility store takes a lot of time. You need to set up the following variables and put the script on the SladeAbility plugin folder:
```python
store = "store.vexpvp.club" # This is an example
domain = "vexpvp.club" # This is an example
```
Only python3 required. No imports or sketchy stuff.
